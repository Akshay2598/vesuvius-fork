The Volunteer Module (VM) for Sahana is a system to track volunteers and projects in the context of an incident.

INSTALLATION

If you already have a copy of Sahana installed:
* place the 'vm' directory inside the 'mod' subdirectory of your Sahana installation
* run the 'dbcreate.sql' script located in the 'ins' directory

If you plan on installing a new copy of Sahana, just make sure the 'vm' directory is inside your 'mod' directory.
The Sahana installer will take care of running the MySQL script.
