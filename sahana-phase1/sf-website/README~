This CVS module contains an exceptionally simple web site that
is placed on shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/s/sa/sahana/{cgi-bin,htdocs}
so that something is visible when people visit http://sahana.sourceforge.net/.

To revise the published site you
  1. Check this module out.
       cvs ... co sf-website
  2. Then copy the site using scp
       scp sf-website/htdocs shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/s/sa/sahana/htdocs

That assumes you have your ssh key installed on sourceforge etc.

Currently there isn't anything in cgi-bin.
