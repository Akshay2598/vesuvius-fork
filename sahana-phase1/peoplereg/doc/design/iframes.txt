Iframes are used for dynamic form content (e.g.: dynamic
selection list).  Here is an example of a dynamic selection
list called "division".

- An iframe is created with the name and ID "division_frame".

- Dynamically generated selection list is named (name and ID)
  "division0".

- A hidden input element is created with the name "division".

- At the "onSubmit" event of the form, value of the "division"
  input element is set to that of the "division0" selection
  list.

- At "onLoad", if the relevent session form variable (say
  "district" say) is set, load the selection list, and set the
  default value again using the session variable "division".
